**INTRODUCTION**

To begin with, there is use to discover our potential to go beyond our native traditional ways for poor agricultural practices with respect to business community and economy. There are much lands which are either bare or neglect, therefore there is need to come up with better mechanisms whereby we can attract players such as landlords(land owners) whose land is not in a proper use/neglected and would be willing to collaborate with other stakeholders(investors/land tenants) on a contract that is guided by the terms and conditions to produce agricultural produce such as food and cash crops, animal products, industrial raw materials and organic manure just to mention few. 

All these would be possible through online platform (e-commerce platform).


**PROPOSED SOLUTIONS**

Cutting-edge technological solutions are thereby needed to be constructed and well planned to get to the bottom of food insecurity in the region. Two types of audiences are targeted to make this viable, that is landlords and investors. Coming up with an online website platform that will act as an intermediate medium to connect the two partners is of a greater essence. The medium that will be in place, will collect the details from both partners such as personal information and corporate if available, also additional information shall be recorded from the landlord's side about the attributes possessed by the piece of land like climatic conditions, soil type, topography and many more, not to mention as well as binding these two partners in a contract. We shall be committed to work with other departments across, one of them being meteorological department for accurate atmospheric projections in that there would be timely tillage and planting, other departments shall be involved as well when it comes to other agricultural practices away from crops.

Since this idea is new and yet to be introduced to the community it has the potential and capacity to bring about traction from the landlords whose land is not into utilisation and as well as investors who would opt to invest in this scheme. After a certain period when the scheme has beared fruits, finally this is where final targeted audience comes in who is a traders/consumers. Now these produce shall be distributed through online purchase or the other alternatives which are not online to the traders and consumers, therefore investors and landlords can finally enjoy the profits.
